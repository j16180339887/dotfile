ssh-keygen
=====
* ssh-keygen on ComputerA
```sh
ssh-keygen
Copy ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub from ComputerA to ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub on ComputerB
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on ComputerB
```

ssh
=====
* A = 192.168.0.1:8888 and B = 192.168.0.2:8888
* Connect from A to B
```sh
ssh B_username@192.168.0.2 -p 8888
```

scp
=====
* A = 192.168.0.1:8888 and B = 192.168.0.2:8888
* Copy from A to B
```sh
scp â€“P 8888 A_username@192.168.0.1:~/foobar.txt /some/local/directory
```

What if I use 3G/4G/Wi-fi on client

* Maybe mosh (mobile ssh) can help
